            <p>Hi, I'm Joe — a technology author and educator with a passion for making complex ideas approachable. My background spans web development, Linux systems, and technical writing, all shaped by years of hands-on experience in the industry. I believe technology should empower, not overwhelm, and my work is dedicated to helping people gain confidence in today's digital world.</p>

            <p>For eleven years, I taught at Apple, guiding customers of all levels to better understand and use their devices. That experience taught me the importance of clear, jargon-free communication and showed me the “aha” moments that come when someone finally feels at ease with technology. From there, I expanded into web development and Linux, drawn to the flexibility and creativity that open-source platforms provide.</p>

            <p>When all of a sudden, I suffered two strokes that have left me homebound. My strokes have affected my balance greatly, which makes it difficult for me to walk or drive. So, I've been studying this that pique my interests, and lately I've been focused on writing about technology and front-end web development. I wrote articles on Medium and Substack, when I decided to combine my interests and now I'm blogging on my own bespoke website. </p>

            <p>Outside of technology, I bring the perspective of someone who grew up Gen X. I remember as a young boy being introduced to an Apple IIe in 4th Grade Elementary School. When I'm not writing, you'll usually find me watching some documentary. I've always got to be learning something. I grew up in New York, and I like to learn as much as I can about my birthplace. You'll also find me listening to music. I love all kinds of music, but I tend to listen to the 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s.</p>

            <p>And while I'm working, I've got a SNL (Saturday Night Live) marathon going on. I'm way back in time with those early episodes. It's a joy to hear the laughter in the background. It brings back a lot of memories growing up in New York. </p>

            <p>Now, I live with my  wife and children just outside Atlanta, GA. In Atlanta, when there's clear skies, it's a very deep, rich blue, with no clouds. It's almost surreal. When the sky is clear and blue like that, I could get lost just looking at the sky. The people here are so nice and friendly, and they get a kick out of my New York accent. The kids are growing and my wife and I will soon be empty nesters. </p>
